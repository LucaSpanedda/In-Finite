# In-Finite

In/Finite is a  live-electronic musical performance based on the Autonomous Complex Adaptive System
we modeled for [Waste Kompost Radio](https://github.com/LucaSpanedda/Waste_Kompost_Radio.git), 
in which audio recording files are processed through the algorithm that gradually decompose over time sound informations. 
The process comes to life by operating a transduction of those mechanisms that as in biological and chemical reactions decompose organic materials into "compost".
In/Finite, is a play on words between the latin terms finitus, and the same word with its negative prefix in- (infinitus), 
in philosophy is the quality of that which has no limits or cannot have a conclusion because it is precisely without an end, 
this title takes inspiration from the mathematical experiment of the apple called "Poincaré's Theorem of Recurrence." 
In mathematics and physics, the Poincaré recurrence theorem states that in a sufficiently complex dynamical system that satisfies certain conditions, 
a particle or object within the system will return to its initial position and state after a certain period of time.
In other words, if an apple is placed in a sealed box with a complex dynamical system, after a sufficiently long time, the apple will return to its initial position and state. 
This theorem has important implications in several scientific disciplines, including physics, mathematics and biology.
